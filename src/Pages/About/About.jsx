    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Hello! I’m <span className="font-semibold text-blue-500">Mahir Siyam</span>, a passionate front-end web developer with a strong focus on building clean, user-friendly, and responsive web interfaces. My journey into programming began with curiosity about how websites work. I started learning HTML and CSS, and quickly found joy in turning ideas into functional, beautiful designs using JavaScript and React.

      <br /><br />
      I enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems and enhance user experience. Whether it’s a dynamic recipe app or a smooth booking platform, I love seeing users interact with something I’ve built. I’m particularly drawn to challenges that involve integrating backend APIs, managing states, and optimizing UI/UX.

      <br /><br />
      Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring photography, watching football, and sometimes sketching. These creative outlets help me stay fresh and bring a new perspective to my development work.

      <br /><br />
      I’m constantly learning, collaborating, and striving to improve. I believe in writing code that not only works but is also clean, scalable, and maintainable.
